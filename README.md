# Introduction

Welcome to the Raft project! The goal of this project is to provide an open-source Rust-based Web Application Firewall for NGINX servers.

**Update (08/11/2023)**

As of this writing, support for the open-source WAF NAXSI has been discontinued. Raft serves as a Rust-based drop-in replacement for NAXSI performing a subset of features available. More to come in the Roadmap.
