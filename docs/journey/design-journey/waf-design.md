# WAF Design

## Requirements

A WAF blocks incoming traffic in one of two ways ([more details here](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/web-application-firewall-waf/)):

* Blocklist which protects against known attacks and
* Allowlists that only admit pre-approved traffic.

A blocklist is analogous to a bouncer at the club that only lets people in if they fit the dress code whereas an allowlist is an exclusive club where only members on the invite list are allowed in.

There are benefits to either of these implementations and thatâ€™s why most WAFs come as hybrid models. Due to time constants, I will only implement a blocklist WAF for now which will scan for the following attacks: SQLi and XSS. Will be adding the allowlist to the roadmap.

## Implementation

There are three ways a WAF can be implemented

1. **Reverse Proxy**: Implement the WAF as a reverse proxy server, such as NGINX or Apache with a Rust-based module or middleware.
2. **Library**: Integrate the WAF logic directly into your web application code using a Rust library.
3. **Standalone Binary**: Develop a standalone Rust binary that acts as a WAF and sits in front of your web application server, inspecting and filtering incoming traffic.
