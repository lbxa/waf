# Ideation

I found a lot of interesting project ideas from this [extensive list](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x). Unfortunately, the ones I found most relevant to the course would take longer than 10 weeks to achieve a reasonable enough quality.

I am leaning towards building (or cloning) an extremely lightweight OS in Rust that I can run penetration tests on. The findings from this experience could be used to prove how unsafe it is to use OSs that donâ€™t have security baked into the kernel.

The content below should be enough inspiration to get me started:

* [Writing an OS in Rust](https://os.phil-opp.com/)
* [The Adventures of OS: Making a RISC-V Operating System Using Rust](https://osblog.stephenmarz.com/)
* [Linux kernel in Rust](https://github.com/fishinabarrel/linux-kernel-module-rust)

As a back up I did like the idea of building a HTML renderer with built-in security like XSS prevention. I thought this was a contrarian idea because web security is normally a layer in the network stack of web applications, not the web browser itself. I have a lot of experience in web development so this one looked achievable and was a big enough challenge.
