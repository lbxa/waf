# Dunning-Kruger Effect

Maybe working with an OS before I take the OS course is too big an undertaking. This was a classic tale of the Dunning-Kruger effect. The more I learnt about OS security the more I realised my Something Awesome would be 80% dealing with my gap in knowledge of OSs and only 20% would be security design. Hence I went back to the drawing boards with a bit of help from my own friend in Figure 1.

I did like the idea of a WAF based on [https://github.com/nbs-system/naxsi](https://github.com/nbs-system/naxsi) plus my tutor gave the stamp of approval. He also suggested this would be way cooler than a browser engine with built-in XSS security. I agreed.
